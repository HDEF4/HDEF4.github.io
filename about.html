The nearest major airports to Armagh are in Belfast and Dublin (Republic of Ireland). Belfast has two airports, <strong><a href="https://www.belfastairport.com">Belfast International Airport</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.belfastcityairport.com">Belfast City Airport</a></strong>, both are ~40 miles from Armagh and are well connected with major UK and European airports. It is also possible to travel to Armagh via <strong><a href="https://www.dublinairport.com/">Dublin Airport</a></strong> in the Republic of Ireland, which is well connected to many major European airports, Dublin is ~80 miles from Armagh.
