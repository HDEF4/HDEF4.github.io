<br />

For general information about Armagh and surrounding areas, see <a href="doc/visitarmagh.pdf">this leaflet</a> published by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and their tourism webpage <a href="http://www.visitarmagh.com">www.visitarmagh.com</a>.<br />

<h1 style="font-size:24pt;"> Getting to Armagh <a id="travel"></a></h1><br />

<br /> Note: Links to transport websites not yet added.<br />


Northern Ireland can be reached by air from many cities in Britain, mainland Europe and beyond, and by ferry from England or Scotland. Belfast has two airports, <strong>Belfast International Airport</strong> and <strong>Belfast City Airport</strong>, both are ~40 miles from Armagh. It is also possible to travel to Northern Ireland via <strong>Dublin Airport</strong> in the Republic of Ireland, which is ~80 miles from Armagh. Note, however, that a separate visa may be required for certain nationals. While further from Armagh, a <strong>direct</strong> (but infrequent) connection exists between Armagh and Dublin Airport, unlike either of the Belfast airports.<br /><br />

<strong style="font-size:15pt"> From Belfast City or Belfast International Airport</strong><br />
A bus service operates from both airports to Belfast Europa Bus Centre. The Translink 300 service from Belfast International Airport operates between 05:00 and 00:00 and takes between 30 and 45 minutes to reach Belfast. The Translink 600 service from Belfast City Airport operates between 05:30 (07:30 on Sundays) and 21:50 and takes about 15 minutes. <br />
The Ulsterbus Goldline services between Belfast Europa Buscentre and Armagh (250/251/270/271) take between 1 and 1.5 hours. Services typically operate between 09:00 and 20:00, although the frequency and operating hours of these services are less at weekends. Please consult the timetable before travelling.<br />
Alternatively, Northern Ireland Railways operate rail services between Belfast city centre and Portadown. Portadown Railway Station is ~10 miles from Armagh. It is advisable to take a taxi from Portdown to Armagh as there are limited buses available.<br /><br />

<strong style="font-size:15pt"> From Dublin Airport</strong><br />
The Ulsterbus X4 service connects Dublin Airport direct to Armagh. There are only a small number of services each way, so it is advisable to consult the timetable before travelling. It is also possible to take a bus from Dublin Airport to Newry (X1 service) and then take a taxi to Armagh. <br />
Northern Ireland Railways and Irish Rail jointly operate an express service between Belfast and Dublin city centre, stopping at Portadown. Portadown Railway Station is ~10 miles from Armagh. It is advisable to take a taxi from Portdown to Armagh as there are limited buses available.<br />
